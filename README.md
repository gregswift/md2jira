# md2jira
A simple go script to convert a markdown file into a hierarchical set of jira tickets

You're right; my apologies for that oversight. Let me fix that for you:

## Build

To build the project, make sure you have Go installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
go build
```

This will generate an executable file named `md2jira` in the current directory.

## Test

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```
go test
```

This will execute all test cases defined in the project.

## Configuration

### Jira Credentials

Jira CLI Tool requires Jira credentials to authenticate with your Jira instance. You can provide these credentials through a configuration file or command-line options.

#### Configuration File

By default, Jira CLI Tool looks for a configuration file named `config.yml` in the `~/.jira.d/` directory. You can specify the Jira endpoint URL, email, and API token in this file using the following format:

```yaml
endpoint: <Jira-URL>
user: <Jira-Email>
token: <API-Token>
```

Replace `<Jira-URL>`, `<Jira-Email>`, and `<API-Token>` with your Jira instance URL, email, and API token respectively.

#### Command-line Options

Alternatively, you can override the configuration file values by passing command-line options. Use the following format:

```
./md2jira --url=<Jira-URL> --user=<Jira-Email> --token=<API-Token>
```

Replace `<Jira-URL>`, `<Jira-Email>`, and `<API-Token>` with your Jira instance URL, email, and API token respectively.

### Additional Configuration

You can also provide additional field settings for Jira issues through command-line options. Use the following format:

```
./md2jira --field="field_name=value"
```

Replace `field_name` with the name of the Jira field you want to set and `value` with the desired value.

## Usage

After building the project and configuring your Jira credentials, you can use the CLI tool to create Jira issues from markdown files. Here's a basic usage example:

```
./md2jira path/to/markdown-file.md
```

Replace `path/to/markdown-file.md` with the path to your markdown file.

For more information on how to format your markdown file for Jira issue creation, please refer to the documentation.
```

Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
